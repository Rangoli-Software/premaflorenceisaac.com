From the unorthodox educational system, to the eco-friendly thinking, from the diverse international community, to the spiritual guidance of The Mother and the influence of the Aurobindo Ashram, Auroville has had a profound impact on my outlook to life and work.</p><p><a href="/journey/salsa.html"><strong>Odissi 2 Salsa!</strong></a> - My creations have always reflected my love of dance. I want my garments to move and flow in perfect sync with the movement of the body. I want anyone wearing my creations to feel comfortable and beautiful!</p><p><a href="/journey/atelier.html"><strong>The Atelier</strong></a> - Beginning in 1999, our team of garment artisans has been hand-crafting world-class garments. I am proud of our quality and the dedication of our people.</p><p><a href="/journey/colour.html"><strong>Rang = Colour</strong></a> - Since childhood I have been fascinated with colour, and it still plays a strong role in my designs. The "rang" in "Rangoli" means "colour" in Sanskrit.</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-sm-6"><figure><img src="/journey/TangailSaris.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block" width="1200" height="1200"><figcaption>Tangail saris</figcaption></figure><p><a href="/journey/tangail.html"><strong>Tangail Traditions</strong></a> - I remain inspired by the qualities of hand-loomed Tangail - super-fine cotton yarn that is worked into a diaphanous, colourful and lightweight fabric. It lets me play with texture, translucency and the layering of colours in my designs. The traditional artisanal origins of this cloth make it a compelling medium for my creations.</p><p><a href="/journey/treasuretrove.html"><strong>Treasure Trove</strong></a> - I value tangail so highly that I have been saving all the unused bits and pieces of fabric, especially the borders. Many of these styles are not woven any more, so these pieces are irreplaceable and invaluable!</p><p><a href="/journey/artwear.html"><strong>Art Wear</strong></a> - An important aspect of my designs arises organically out of the way in which hand-loomed tangail saris are made and sold: they are naturally a limited-edition product. Faced with this reality, I wound up creating my one-of-a-kind line of Art Wear garments.</p><p><a href="/journey/pfifabrics.html"><strong>P.F.I. Tangail</strong></a> - Inspired by visits to the traditional weaving communities, I began designing my own Tangail fabrics. For over 10 years, I have been collaborating with the weavers. We work together on the designs, which the weavers then manifest as custom fabrics that are exclusive to Rangoli.</p><p><a href="/journey/evolution.html"><strong>Evolution</strong></a> - I'm largely a self-taught designer. Traveling the world, meeting inspirational artists, interacting with different cultures - these life experiences have allowed me to grow as a person and enriched my work.</p><p>The journey continues. I'm excited by what the future holds in store. Although we have primarily sold through high-end boutiques up to now, I am anticipating the day when we can reach out to thousands of discerning new clients world-wide on the internet. I look forward to showing all of you the new creations!</p><p class="text-right"><strong>Prema Florence Isaac</strong></p></div></div><hr><div class="row justify-content-between"><div class="col-xs-6"></div><div class="col-xs-6"><a href="/journey/auroville.html"><strong>Auroville <i class="fe fe-chevrons-right"></i></strong></a></div></div><script>pfiavG.pageIdx.includePages([pfiavG.pageIdx.page]),$(document).ready(onDocumentReady);</script></div><script>document.write(pfiavG.pageIdx.createFeatures());</script><script>document.write(botMenu("/journey/myjourney.html"));</script><script>document.write(scriptSrcs());</script></body></html>
