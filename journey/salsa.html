I studied ballet, jazz, and contemporary dance, with resident and visiting international dance teachers. I also studied the classical Indian dance forms of Bharatnatyam and Odissi with the best local teachers of gurukul lineages.</p><p>As a teenager, I dreamt of auditioning with the great dance companies that had inspired me: the Bejart Ballet Lausanne and the Martha Graham Dance Company. I never went fully professional, but if you look carefully, you'll see me in several of the Bollywood-style ensemble dance sequences in Jackie Chan's "The Myth" :-).</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-sm-4"><p>When I was a young adult, I was seriously considering the study of Odissi as a lifetime pursuit. Anupama, my BFF at the time, and I were studying the dance together and her mother gifted me with a number of saris for practice. Anupama's parents were Bengali, and these saris were my first major exposure to the magnificent Bengali Tangail and Jamdani weaves.</p><p>Eventually I realized that Odissi was not my calling, and that I could not do the art-form the justice it deserved. I was deeply disappointed but moved on and found a passion for another entirely different dance - Salsa!</p><figure><img src="/journey/GGGPere.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"><figcaption>See the resemblance?</figcaption></figure><p>My great-great grandfather, Pierre Alexandre Isaac, was the Senator of Guadeloupe. There are still 3 main streets in Guadeloupe named after him, as well as a statue of him in the main square. So perhaps it was my Caribbean roots, but I instantly connected with the Afro-Caribbean music and movements of Salsa. For many years it was an obsession for me, and I traveled extensively to study and dance Salsa.</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-sm-4"><figure><img src="/journey/NakshaEvolution.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"><figcaption>An early Naksha skirt; the current version</figcaption></figure><p>Left with these gorgeous saris which I could no longer dance Odissi in, I decided to transform them into skirts that I could wear while dancing and peforming salsa. These skirts, each made from a single Tangail sari, were early versions of what was to become my signature piece and best-seller, the <strong>Naksha</strong> skirt. Soon, salsa dancers and other friends were asking me where I got my skirts, and I started getting requests to make and sell them.</p><p class="text-right"><strong>Prema Florence Isaac</strong></p></div></div><hr><div class="row justify-content-between"><div class="col-xs-6"><p class="text-left"><a href="/journey/auroville.html"><strong><i class="fa fa-angle-left"></i><i class="fa fa-angle-left"></i><i class="fa fa-angle-left"></i> Auroville</strong></a></p></div><div class="col-xs-6"><p class="text-right"><a href="/journey/atelier.html"><strong>The Atelier <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i></strong></a></p></div></div><script>$(document).ready(onDocumentReady);</script></div><script>document.write(storyBrowser(pg_blacklist));</script><script>document.write(botMenu("/journey/salsa.html"));</script><script>document.write(scriptSrcs());</script></body></html>
