<h1>Tour Groups: Visiting the Rangoli Atelier</h1>

<p>We have recently had several groups of (mostly) lady tourists from Canada, China, Taiwan, Germany and France visit our atelier, which is within a stone’s throw of Matrimandir, the center and focal point of Auroville.</p>

<p>These ladies greatly enjoyed meeting Prema. Some of them asked her about her experiences of growing up in Auroville in the 70s and 80s. They wanted to know what it was like to have lived here her whole life, under the influence of the philosophy of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. They were interested in the Rangoli story, which is basically a reflection of Prema’s life journey. They also connected on a personal level with Prema, who is a well-traveled citizen of the world, and speaks multiple languages including French, English and Tamil (with some Spanish and German thrown in).</p>

<p>They enjoyed touring the Rangoli workshop, seeing the design process up-close, and meeting the skilled craftsmen and craftswomen that construct our garments.</p>

<p>Most of all, they were delighted by their purchase of our clothing, each a perfectly-fitting piece, selected in consultation with Prema, and individually tailored to the exact measurements of the client. They appreciated having the garments delivered to them at the promised time so that they could continue their travel without stress.</p>

<p>Our products are relatively high-priced. Many of our creations are more than Rs. 10K (150 Euro) and our higher-end collections are in the Rs 25K - 35K range (350 - 500 Euro).</p>

<p>Our garments appeal especially to affluent customers of taste and refinement, who are passionate about the textile and garment arts. Such clients find our designs, fabrics and production quality to be world-class, comparable to the best that they can buy in LA, New York, London, Paris or Milan.</p>

<p>If you are a group visiting the Pondicherry / Auroville that fits this profile, you might enjoy the opportunity to visit Prema at Rangoli. Many visitors have appreciated the personal perspective on Auroville that they gain from interacting with Prema, and have seen the Rangoli visit as being an important part of their Auroville discovery.</p>

<p>Visits to the studio are by appointment only. This is to ensure that the atelier is fully prepared to deliver the best possible experience to your group.</p>

<p>You can enjoy sipping the masala chai / espresso and tasting the savouries served to you in the back garden, getting measured for your garments, looking around the workshop, and selecting items in consultation with Prema. For bespoke tailoring, it is sometimes best to schedule a second visit for trials and final modifications.</p>

<p>If you think a visit to our fashion design studio-in-the-wilderness would be of interest, please get in touch with us to discuss the matter further.</p>
