Ties are interesting because they are worn predominantly in formal or business settings. Yet the tie is an item of business attire which has <strong>personality</strong>. Soft tangail borders, with their refined, understated, luxurious look are perfect for a premium tie.</p><p>Even though the basic design has been in my mind for years, I never seemed able to find the time to execute the idea. Last year, as we were finishing our flamboyant <strong>Vagabond</strong> Menswear, it finally felt like the right time, and I managed to manifest this arty neckwear.</p><p></p></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><figure><img src="/products/men/kagera/14.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>For the body of the tie, I used two layers of a textured cotton. Each tie has a black back, and a coloured front. The black cotton is a pure shade, but all the other colours are blends.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><figure><img src="/products/men/kagera/15.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>Two different hues of yarn are loomed together, yielding a cloth with a two-tone colour. The rustic appearance of this fabric lends the tie an air of roughshod elegance.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><figure><img src="/products/men/kagera/19.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>To this base, I added the sophisticated sensuality of a soft tangail border. For each base, I picked a border that would harmonize with the two-tone colour. Some of these borders are from my <strong>Tangail <a href="/journey/treasuretrove.html">Treasure Trove</a></strong> of impossible-to-find borders.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><figure><img src="/products/men/kagera/16.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>The others borders are custom, <a href="/journey/pfifabrics.html">designed by me in collaboration with the artisanal Tangail weavers</a>, and hand-loomed by them exclusively for Rangoli. Some are hand-spun cotton, others are silk, all are exquisite!</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><figure><img src="/products/men/kagera/12.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>I was so pleased with the result that I was inspired to make a matching bag using the same fabric and border.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><figure><img src="/products/men/kagera/11.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>It makes a great gift bag to present the tie!</p></div></div><div class="item"><p>All of the ties can be worn with neutral coloured suits for business wear. The black and grey can be worn for formal occasions, and the coloured ones with a coordinated evening jacket for a night out, or even with just a shirt and jeans.</p><figure><img src="/products/men/kagera/17.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>I designed many combinations, some of which could only be made in limited quantities, due to the scarcity of the border. At the moment, we have <a href="/products/men/kagera.html">6 ties available</a></p></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2"><figure><script>var items=[{url:"/products/men/kagera/kag2.jpg"},{url:"/products/men/kagera/kag3.jpg"}];document.write(createFlickityCarousel("carousel-kagera",items,{width:1500,height:2e3}));</script></figure></div></div><div class="item"><p>The ties had just been finished when we did our photo shoot for Vagabond. The model was our favorite world-traveling maverick, photographer and documentary film-maker Sri Kolari, and the photographer for the shoot was Samvit Blass, creator and executive at Light Fish Designs.</p><p>We got to fooling around with the tie and they both wound up modeling it - Sri in the Blue and Samvit in the Red. I think you'll agree that the results were really interesting!</p></div><div class="item"><p class="text-right"><strong>Prema Florence Isaac</strong></p></div><script>pfiavG.pageIdx.includePages([pfiavG.pageIdx.page]),$(document).ready(onDocumentReady);</script></div><script>document.write(pfiavG.pageIdx.createFeatures());</script><script>document.write(botMenu("/products/ties/kagera.html"));</script><script>document.write(scriptSrcs());</script><script src="/shopper-1.0.4/libs/@fancyapps/fancybox/dist/jquery.fancybox.min.js"></script><script src="/shopper-1.0.4/libs/flickity/dist/flickity.pkgd.min.js"></script><script src="/shopper-1.0.4/libs/flickity-fade/flickity-fade.js"></script><script src="/shopper-1.0.4/js/theme.min.js"></script></body></html>
