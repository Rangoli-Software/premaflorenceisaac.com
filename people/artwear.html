These images first appeared in Erika's story <a href="http://www.lesvoyagesderika.fr/mon-look-reves-de-cuba-by-rangoli/" target="_blank">Dreams of Cuba</a>. Blogger, singer, model and world traveler - Erika was the model for our <a href="/summerdreams.html">Midsummer Night's Dream mood</a>.</p><div class="row"><div class="col col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"><figure><img src="/people/EricaNaksha0.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>The Naksha skirt - in 4 lengths - micro, mini, midi and minuit - is my signature silhouette. Each skirt is made from a single Tangail or Jamdani saree, matched with the appropriate lining to give a distinctive light-layering effect, where a third colour is visible due to the translucency of the fine Bengal muslin.</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"><figure><img src="/people/EricaNaksha1.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>Each skirt is unique, cut from a single (usually one-of-a-kind) saree. The first version of the skirt was created almost 20 years ago, and I have created thousands of them since. I'm pretty sure no two have been identical. It is a super-comfortable, easy-to-wear piece, allowing free movement, and suitable for all ages and occasions.</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"><figure><img src="/people/EricaNaksha2.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block"></figure><p>The first Naksha skirts were created for me to wear while dancing and performing Salsa, so they had to be comfortable and allow full freedom of movement.</p><p>Since it is a crushed skirt - the garment is twisted into a rope in the final stages of drying and stored as such - it travels easily and does not require ironing. The resulting crinkling of the fabric adds additional texture to it's visual appearance.</p></div></div></section><script>$(document).ready(onDocumentReady);</script></div><script>document.write(pfiavG.pageIdx.createFeatures());</script><script>document.write(botMenu("/people/artwear.html"));</script><script>document.write(scriptSrcs());</script></body></html>
