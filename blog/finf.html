In the panoramic background of the first picture, you can clearly see the famous Duomo and the bell-tower of the Badia Florentina. The second image shows a bronze replica of Michelangelo's David that graces the terrace of the square.</p><p>In these pictures, I am wearing my own creations. The leggings are in modal jersey with decorative jeans-style stitching for faux hip-pockets and seams. I originally created these Jeggings en soie, in a sexy silk spandex, and the jersey version came later. The top is a Border-Back(less) Top, in modal jersey, with my P.F.I Tangail borders used to create the patchwork style half-back. This creation showcases another of my signature design elements - the use of cutouts and windows in unusual places.The look is completed by the Handloom Handbag, a Pom-Pom ear-cuff and Pom-Pom bangles.</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-sm-4"><figure><img src="/blog/FlorYellow.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block" width="1125" height="1407"></figure><p>I spent the afternoon at the lovely Boboli Gardens, a beautiful park created by the Medicis in the 16th century. I found this wall just outside. There was a public drinking water fountain beside it, one of the very few that we found in the city.</p><p>Here I'm wearing my Celia Skirt in the Black and Silver P.F.I. Tangail, accessorized by a Pom-Pom ear-cuff and Pom-Pom bangles. And yes, the sun-glasses are cute, but those are by Dior, not by me.</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-sm-4"><figure><img src="/blog/FlorDuomo.jpg" class="img-fluid center-block" width="1200" height="1500"></figure><p>This is taken from the breakfast terrace of my hotel. As you can see, the location was fantastic, with a stunning view of the Duomo Cathedral, one of the architectural wonders of the world. It took almost 150 years to construct, and was finished in the 15th century.</p><p>I had to buy tickets 3 days in advance to visit the dome, and even the free entry to the cathedral section involved a wait of hours in a queue that snaked around several blocks (I gave that a miss :-). It was high tourist season in Florence!!</p><p>Here I'm wearing one of my one-of-a-kind Sari Art Wear pieces --- what I call a Long Overtop. Although the silhouette appears to have been discovered by a broader market recently, I've been creating variations on the Overtop theme for at least 15 years, and it is one of my signature styles.</p></div></div><p><strong>Photography by Jean-Luc Rique</strong></p><script>$(document).ready(onDocumentReady);</script></div><script>document.write(storyBrowser());</script><script>document.write(botMenu("/blog/finf.html"));</script><script>document.write(scriptSrcs());</script></body></html>
